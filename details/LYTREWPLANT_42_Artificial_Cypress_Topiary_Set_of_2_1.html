I have boxwood plants in my yard that just won't grow, so I needed something to fill the space with greenery that would easily blend with my other plants. The size is perfect, and the color of the topiaries is spot on! They honestly look realistic both up close and from a distance.Setting them up was easy; I had to fluff out the branches, install the stake at the bottom, and press them into the ground. It took just about five minutes to transform my lackluster backyard. The best part is that I donâ€™t have to waste water on them, and I can easily transport them wherever I want. They are lightweight yet sturdy, and once they are placed in the ground, they stay put.These topiaries are of very nice quality and look great in both small and large spaces.",

They provide a beautiful, natural look without the constant upkeep of real plants. No more worrying about under or overwatering, and I never have to think about changing seasons affecting their appearance!The UV-resistant rating ensures that these topiaries maintain their rich green color, even when exposed to direct sunlight. Unlike some artificial plants that fade over time, these hold up beautifully in outdoor conditions, making them an excellent choice for gardens, patios, or even entryways. The included spike design makes installation a breeze\u2014just push them into the ground or secure them in decorative planters for a polished look.Indoors, they work just as well, bringing a touch of greenery to any room without requiring any maintenance. The realistic detailing of the leaves and branches gives them an authentic look that blends seamlessly with any decor style.This set of two topiaries is an absolute winner. Whether rain or shine, they always look fresh, vibrant, and perfectly shaped.

Easy to Push in The Ground 3.5FT Home Garden Decor Set of 2\" and I am very pleased with how they are shaping up - literally!These two faux cedar topiaries are exactly what I was looking for to use in a problematic area of my back yard.The ground stays soggy and I've got some drainage issues going on, and eventually that whole space will get completely redesigned.Until then, however, I wanted to make the space look better - at least to make it look as if it isn't a problem area that's actively being ignored.These two artificial shrubs are exactly what I needed to make the space look at least a tiny bit less neglected.I like that these fake mini-trees are UV-resistant, but how effective their UV-resistance is won't be clear for a while (hopefully).I am putting these outside in the southeastern U.S. and their UV-resistance will truly be put to the test, but not for another 5-6 months at least.Should they discolor or deteriorate in some way, I'll definitely come back to this review to update.Until then, the only thing I have to complain about with these is that shaping them takes forever.It's worth it, definitely, but it's a time-consuming process.Just try to set it up so you can do it almost in the background.Watch a movie or something and spend the time shaping some branches instead of scrolling on your phone! :DThis pair of faux-evergreens are just what I was looking for and they seem reasonably priced at $79.99 (their posted price as I type this review).Over all, a good find that I'm happy recommending to others.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-28 19:46:55"},{"user":"Dacia","content":"Let me preface this by saying I\u2019m not a gardener. I\u2019m more of a \u201cwater plants occasionally and hope for the best\u201d kind of person. So when my patio looked like a sad, neglected corner of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, I knew drastic measures were needed. Enter: two 42-inch tall, artificial cypress topiaries. Think of them as the glamorous, eternally-green, slightly condescending cousins of my actual, struggling succulents.First impressions? They arrived looking surprisingly\u2026alive. Okay, not alive, but convincingly not-dead. The realism is impressive. My neighbor, bless his easily-fooled heart, actually asked if I\u2019d gotten into bonsai. (He hasn't noticed my actual bonsai has mostly given up the ghost.) The UV resistance is a plus; I suspect these beauties will outlast my current commitment to responsible plant care.Installation was a breeze. The \"spike to anchor into ground\" is less \"spike\" and more \"glorified pointy stick,\" but it did the job. I envisioned a dramatic, earth-shattering plunge, but in reality, it was more of a gentle nudge. Perhaps I need to work on my ground-stabbing technique.Now, the humor part. These topiaries have a definite personality. They stand there, perfectly coiffed, judging my less-than-perfect gardening attempts with silent, green disapproval. I half expect them to whisper sarcastic comments about my brown thumb when I'm not looking. It's actually quite motivational; I feel pressured to improve my plant game just to avoid their silent judgment.Overall, would I recommend them? Absolutely. If you're looking to instantly upgrade your outdoor space without the commitment of actual plant parenting (or the guilt of letting them die), these are your guys. Just be prepared for a permanent dose of passive-aggressive plant-based scrutiny. They're fabulous, albeit slightly judgmental, additions to my patio. Five stars, minus one for the slight intimidation factor.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-31 19:46:55"},{"user":"Taterlayne","content":"These LYTREWPLANT 42\" Artificial Cypress Topiary Cedar Topiaries are a fantastic way to enhance your home d\u00e9cor with a touch of natural beauty.

I'm always hesitant about buying these online because they certainly vary in how realistic they look. These are just the right shade of green, the fronds on the branches are fine and look realistic and are easy to fluff up to whatever fullness you want.

They honestly look realistic both up close and from a distance.Setting them up was easy; I had to fluff out the branches, install the stake at the bottom, and press them into the ground. It took just about five minutes to transform my lackluster backyard. The best part is that I don\u2019t have to waste water on them, and I can easily transport them wherever I want.
