I started to look at the various sticky things that can be added under the rug to keep them secure. I decided I didn't really want the solutions that required basically gluing the rugs to the hardwood floor. Then I ran across this Home Techpro Rug Pad Gripper that consists of little rubber "mats" with one sticky side that attaches them to the underside of the rugs. The side that contacts the hardwood floor is ribbed, rubbery substance that simply creates friction between the rug and the floor. No glue involved so no worries about removing any residue. I can't vouch for the concept of "vacuum TECH" but these little pads do seem to work as advertised. Since placing them at each corner of my rugs, the rugs don't move a bit. Highly recommend trying these as a first step in securing slipping rugs. Will purchase again if I have more rugs to hold down.",

They keep my rugs firmly in place, even in high-traffic areas like my living room and hallway. The Vacuum TECH technology is remarkable, and I appreciate how I can adjust the grip strength depending on the rug\u2019s material and size.Durability:These grippers have shown no signs of wear and tear despite repeated use and washing. They still provide the exact excellent grip I had when I first purchased them. Their durability is a testament to their high-quality construction.Value for Money:While the Home Techpro Rug Pad Gripper is slightly more expensive than other options, it is worth every penny. The peace of mind and convenience it provides far outweigh the cost. I highly recommend these grippers to anyone who values a safe and tidy home environment.Conclusion:If you\u2019re looking for the best rug grippers, look no further than the Home Techpro Rug Pad Gripper.

I have tried mats, other forms of tape, etc. but so far like this the best, here\u2019s why -I\u2019ve used other corner tape products that are similar in concept to this, the problem with others are they adhere more strongly to the floor than the rug, and it seems to cause it to lose adhesion to the rug and then you have to peel them off the floor. It also means you can\u2019t lift the rug for cleaning without ruining the bond to the rug in the early days while the product still works. These corner tapes, on the other hand hand, can easily be lifted off the floor for cleaning, and because of that the bond seams stronger on the rug. I have high hopes that these will last and work better than other tapes, and even if they don\u2019t last, at least they work as advertised when new, this is my second purchase, as I was do happy with the results on the first rugs, I needed to use them in a third. Definitely recommend!","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 4   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-04 19:46:57"},{"user":"Locutus65","content":"I've tried various other means to keep my memory foam kitchen rugs in place. The back of the rugs are quite porous and often other things simply didn't stick well.Not the case with the TechPro pads. I used a Mr. Clean sponge to clean the area where the pads would go then dried thoroughly. Attached the pads and placed the rugs on the smooth ceramic tile floor. Gave a good pressing step on each corner and POOF they are secure.Yet, I can quite easily pull the rugs up, you can hear the pads release their grip on the floor yet they leave zero residue because of the vacuum technology used. I wish I had discovered these a long time ago!","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 12   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-24 19:46:57"},{"user":"K.","content":"After eight weeks of testing these grippers on multiple rugs across various flooring types, I can confirm that Home Techpro's \"Vacuum TECH\" design offers significant improvements over traditional rug grippers.Testing Environment:Hardwood floors (living room)Tile flooring (kitchen and bathroom)Laminate flooring (home office)Multiple rug types: low-pile, medium-pile, and area rugsHigh-traffic areas with both human and pet foot trafficInstallation & Initial Setup:Surface prep was minimal - just needed basic cleaningInstallation took about 2 minutes per rugGrippers adhered instantlyCorners flattened within 24 hoursNo bubbling or partial lifting during placementPerformance By Flooring Type:Hardwood:Excellent grip without any residueNo slipping even with vacuum useProtected floor finish as promisedTile:Strong adhesion to both rug and grout linesMaintained grip even in humid bathroom conditionsNo issues with daily mopping around edgesLaminate:Perfect adhesion without damageSurvived office chair rolling over cornersNo residue when repositionedDurability Testing:After 8 weeks:No corner curling on any rugsAdhesive remained strongSuccessfully survived multiple vacuum sessionsWithstood furniture movementMaintained effectiveness after washing\"Vacuum TECH\" Features That Actually Work:Special edge design prevents vacuum suction from lifting cornersImproved air flow reduces corner curlingStronger center grip prevents rug shiftingEasily removable despite strong holdReusable after washing (tested 3 times)Unexpected Benefits:Reduced trip hazards significantlyImproved vacuum cleaning efficiencyProtected flooring from rug backingMade rugs look more professionally installedExtended rug life by preventing edge wearMinor Limitations:Initial placement needs to be preciseRequires 24 hours for optimal corner flatteningWorks best when rug is cleaned firstMay need replacement after multiple washingsSlightly visible under very thin rugsPractical Applications:Successfully tested on:Entryway runnersKitchen area rugsBathroom matsLarge living room area rugsOffice chair matsPet feeding area matsMaintenance Notes:Easily cleaned with warm waterAir dry completely before reuseCan be repositioned without losing effectivenessDust/debris brushes off easilyMaintains grip after cleaningValue Analysis:16 grippers provide enough coverage for:4 medium-sized rugs (4 corners each)2 large area rugs (8 corners each)Multiple smaller rugsThe price per use, considering reusability, makes these an excellent value.Final Verdict:4.9/5 stars. Home Techpro's Rug Grippers represent a genuine improvement over traditional options. The \"Vacuum TECH\" feature isn't just marketing - it actually helps prevent corner lifting during regular cleaning. While slightly pricier than basic grippers, their reusability, durability, and superior performance justify the cost.The only reason they don't get a perfect score is the slight visibility under very thin rugs, though this is a minor issue that affects all rug grippers. For anyone tired of kicking rug corners back down or constantly repositioning shifted rugs, these grippers are a worthwhile investment.Pro Tip: Buy an extra pack for future use - you'll likely find more rugs that need these once you see how well they work.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 16   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-12 19:46:57"},{"user":"Robyn Simmons","content":"I\u2019ve been using these rug grippers on my hardwood floors, and they\u2019ve been a game-changer!

These grippers are a must-have if you want to keep your rugs in place while still maintaining a safe and clean look in your home.Highly recommend for anyone with pets or kids!","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 4   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-09 19:46:57"},{"user":"Kate Lutter","content":"I half expected this product not to work, but it does. I ordered one package and have used all 8 on rugs around the house that sit on a floor or tile. This is why I like it. I had a few rugs that were slipping and sliding all over the place. I used two grippers on one rug, one on either side. They firmly adhere to the rug, but then they suction down to the floor, which means you can carefully lift the rug, clean under it, and reapply the suction part to the floor to stabilize the rug again. I love this feature! I showed my lovely cleaning lady and she ordered some for her rugs!! 5 stars","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 8   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-28 19:46:57"},{"user":"Jessica Darga","content":"I have had these for 2 weeks on the small rug by my front door.I was worried because that small run sits on top of a cute area rug that my hubby bough for me, but the only place it fits well is in the front entry, but it leaves a few inches right at the door where the small rug can sit on the tile.Without these or anything else the small rug shifts with every step.With tape rolls underneath it moved with every other step and I was replacing the tape rolls once a week if not more.These adhered to the back of the small rug even though I hadn't done more than dust off the back.I only used two figuring worst case scenario I could add more if need be.But these work really well and I'm super happy with these!No adjusting required.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 4   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-11 19:46:57"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"I like that these adhere to the rug, not the floor. What makes them work is that they have a gripping, almost sticky surface that keeps them adhered to the floor. But they do not stick to the floor, just grip. They stick to the rug. They are removable from the rug although I don't know why you would want to remove them. Only problem is, for me, they were not reusable but that's not really a problem. If you want to move the rug, pick it up, and then put it back down where you want and the grippers work again. I have three 20 pound poodles who like to zoom around chasing each other and none of my rugs with these have moved. I have used other things but they stick to the floor and can leave a mess behind when you move the rug or pull it up to clean. Not with these grippers. You really have to try them to understand how good they are. I have LVT throughout my home so that's the only thing I can speak about.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 12   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-07 19:46:57"},{"user":"Annapolis man","content":"I have had a couple of rugs in my kitchen that just don't want to stay in place, despite having a \"non-slip\" padding underneath. I started to look at the various sticky things that can be added under the rug to keep them secure. I decided I didn't really want the solutions that required basically gluing the rugs to the hardwood floor. Then I ran across this Home Techpro Rug Pad Gripper that consists of little rubber \"mats\" with one sticky side that attaches them to the underside of the rugs. The side that contacts the hardwood floor is ribbed, rubbery substance that simply creates friction between the rug and the floor. No glue involved so no worries about removing any residue. I can't vouch for the concept of \"vacuum TECH\" but these little pads do seem to work as advertised. Since placing them at each corner of my rugs, the rugs don't move a bit. Highly recommend trying these as a first step in securing slipping rugs. Will purchase again if I have more rugs to hold down.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 4   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-02 19:46:57"}];
